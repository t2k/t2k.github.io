		<h3>The good parts!</h3>
		<p>Dropping code like it's hot.  From time to time I create things worthy of sharing.  This site is here to document some of the idea's and techniques that I've implemented in personal projects.  Too often, I'll look back on code and regret that I didn't put more effort into documention.  I'll drop code used to create web apps primarily related to topics in finance.</p>
